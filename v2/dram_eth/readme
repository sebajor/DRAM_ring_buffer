This model is sample test for a ring buffer for roch2 adc data.

We have 3 counters running emulating the input data comming from the 
3 inputs ADC (we use the fourth as rfi detector).
For each value we keep 4 bits ie the total amount of data is 32x3 bits
96 so we need 3 cycles to collect the 288 bits.


After the 3 cycles we keep the data in a register and enable the DRAM writing

We read the dram in burst of 220 addresses which give us 7920bytes,
we input that data into a fifo and in the reading fifo side we use a 
parallel input-serial output to feed the ethernet block with 8 bit words.
Once we have the 7920 packet form we generate a eof pulse, which enable the
reading of new 220 addresses again and triggers the message send.
The process is repeated for n_pkt times.

After some testing we arrive to the values of the parameters in init.py file
When you run it the dram get written, then reading and send the data via 
ethernet.
To check if the data is consistent you could run the script test.py which 
review if there is some missing data. If there is a failure review the
parameters of the model.. the usual problem is the n_pkt and the 
sleeping time between sends.
