Setup:
    #you need to set this up or yyou are not going to receive
    #data from the roach!
    set ipv4 in manual mode with address
    ip: 10.0.0.29
    netmask: 255.255.255.255
    gateway 10.0.0.1
    
    the dns and routes could be set in automatic mode


The parse_data files are c wrappers to handle the translation between the
data in 4 bit format to a char who could be handled by the stadard libraries
(We made it in c because the python option was terrible slow)..you could call
this wrappers in python using ctypes, see test.py for a demo
